                     somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You see like an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and just<br>
                    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>

                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratol(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers 30&degC(86&degF),when the<br>

            <strong>Exotic dance moves</strong>
            <p>Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctrate work,I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,my favorite dances are as follows,with definitions:</p>
            <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>

            
             <p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp; A little known but <em>very</em> influence dance dating as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around<br>
             </p><p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to  be "fruitful".</p>
            </p><p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p> 
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which<br>
                    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
            modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Arctic robot dance</p>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
            discovered a new a dance style characterised by "robotic",stiled movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
        of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
    because they were really cold. </p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
